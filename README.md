# ZOHO CRM PYTHON SDK 7.0 for API version 7

The Python SDK for Zoho CRM allows developers to easily create Python applications that can be integrated with Zoho CRM. This SDK serves as a wrapper for the REST APIs, making it easier to access and utilize the services of Zoho CRM. 
Authentication to access the CRM APIs is done through OAuth2.0, and the authentication process is streamlined through the use of the Python SDK. The grant and access/refresh tokens are generated and managed within the SDK code, eliminating the need for manual handling during data synchronization between Zoho CRM and the client application.

This repository includes the Python SDK for API v7 of Zoho CRM. Check [Versions](https://github.com/zoho/zohocrm-python-sdk-7.0/releases) for more details on the versions of SDK released for this API version.

## Including the SDK in your project
You can include the SDK to your project using:

- For including the latest [version](https://github.com/zoho/zohocrm-python-sdk-7.0/releases/tag/6.0.0)

    - Install **Python** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if not installed).

    - Install **Python SDK**
        - Navigate to the workspace of your client app.
        - Run the command below:

        ```sh
        pip install zohocrmsdk7_0
        ```
    - The Python SDK will be installed in your client application.


**NOTE** 

> - The **access and refresh tokens are environment-specific and domain-specific**. When you handle various environments and domains such as **Production**, **Sandbox**, or **Developer** and **IN**, **CN**, **US**, **EU**, **JP**, or **AU**, respectively, you must use the access token and refresh token generated only in those respective environments and domains. The SDK throws an error, otherwise.
For example, if you generate the tokens for your Sandbox environment in the CN domain, you must use only those tokens for that domain and environment. You cannot use the tokens generated for a different environment or a domain.

> - For **Deal Contact Roles API and Records API**, you will need to provide the **ZohoCRM.settings.fields.ALL** scope along with the **ZohoCRM.modules.ALL** scope while generating the OAuthtoken. Otherwise, the system returns the **OAUTH-SCOPE-MISMATCH** error.

> - For **Related Records API**, the scopes required for generating OAuthtoken are **ZohoCRM.modules.ALL**, **ZohoCRM.settings.fields.ALL** and **ZohoCRM.settings.related_lists.ALL**. Otherwise, the system returns the **OAUTH-SCOPE-MISMATCH** error.

> - For **Mass Convert API**, you will need to provide the **ZohoCRM.settings.fields.ALL** scope along with the **ZohoCRM.mass_convert.leads.CREATE** and **ZohoCRM.mass_convert.leads.READ** scope while generating the OAuthtoken. Otherwise, the system returns the **OAUTH-SCOPE-MISMATCH** error.
